# 10 Karma, Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

​

# Description

The Logo Generator is a command-line application that allows users to create custom logos by combining text and geometric shapes. Users can specify the text, text color, shape type, and shape color to generate a unique logo in SVG format. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles and testing with Jest to ensure the functionality of different shape classes.

# Tasks

Create classes for different geometric shapes, including Triangle, Square, and Circle.
Implement methods within each shape class to generate SVG code based on user-defined properties.
Use Inquirer to collect user input for text, text color, shape type, and shape color.
Generate an SVG logo based on user input and save it as "logo.svg."
Implement unit tests using Jest to ensure the correctness of shape rendering.
Modify the generated SVG code to include selected colors and shapes.
Create an "examples" folder and save one generated logo.
Record a walkthrough video demonstrating how to use the Logo Generator.
